**Where AI Debates Get Dramatic**

A multi-agent AI conversation platform where 2-4 AI models debate, collaborate, and discuss any topic with dramatic flair. Think of it as "tech meets soap opera" – different AI personalities clash and explore ideas together.

## 💰 Pricing Model

| Usage | Cost |
|-------|------|
| **Self-hosted** | Free (bring your own API keys) |
| **Cloud (froste.eu)** | Free credits to start, then pay-per-use for AI model calls |

The code is **100% free and open source** under MIT license. You can run your own instance with your own OpenRouter API key at no cost (except API usage).

The hosted version at [froste.eu](https://www.froste.eu) provides convenience with managed infrastructure, but charges for AI model usage to cover API costs.

## 🎯 Philosophy

SiliconSoap is built around transparency and open-weight AI models. We believe:

- **Open models deserve a showcase** – Let people experience Llama, Mistral, Qwen side-by-side
- **AI should be accessible** – Free to explore, learn, and experiment
- **Transparency matters** – Open source code, open-weight models, open conversations
